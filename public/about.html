<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Over the past decade i have sought to understand the way life works and the path every man ought to take in attaining
  enlightenment. Though this journey has left me with some hurts, i must say that the lessons are most invaluable. Meeting
  thougt leaders and strategic personalities in many field of work have not only shifted my paradigm but it has added the 
  fine touch of my character.

<p>God is most important, and i must say finding Him not in the statudims of religion or as a passing duty is very critical.
  The God that must be found, must first reveal the details of your within and call our the light that has always been 
  resident within you. Shun the temptations to tilt to the left or the right, understanding that God has principles- in study, 
  communion, and fellowship you can then determine for yourself the right mind in judging certain parameters. Do not 
  be in the outer court.</p>

<p>In conclusion i have decided to learn programming, and my teacher Dr. Angely Yu has been very amazing. You can check
  our her course on udemy. Bye for now till we see at the coding hill. </p>
